music fiddle
============

_The jsfiddle for music_
Another open source way to share music online in a simple and quick way, being able to record with multitracks at the same time and share it without even being logged in. 
The key here is the HTML5 Audio API.


####Proof of concept (STILL IN PROGRESS)

* You will be able to record untill 5 mins., and that will be recorded in the cloud with the link available for anyone to listen to it.
* The server will have a limited space so we will delete the unseenests tracks in the db.
* After you share it, the other person is able to EDIT your track, so this app needs to support multitracking.


####What do we use?

The UI is hosted on GitHub pages. AngularJS, AngularUI (BootstrapUI and UIRoute), less, grunt, ...

The API is hosted on ???. NodeJS (or Scala?)

Under the MIT Liscence.
