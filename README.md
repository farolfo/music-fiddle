music fiddle
============

Another open source way to share music online in a simple and quick way, being able to record with multitracks at the same time and share it without even being logged in.
(The jsfiddle for music)

####Proof of concept

* You will be able to record untill 5 mins., and that will be recorded in the cloud with the link available for anyone to listen to it.
* The server will have a limited space so we will delete the unseenests tracks in the db.
